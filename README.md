## Game rules
This is a 1v1 game where prove your intelligence. Every player chooses a 4 different digits number that doesn't start with 0. And all numbers used in this game apply to this criteria.
The game is about trying to guess your opponent's number in the fastest way which means the less tries the better. The result of a played turn is a couple of digits Bulls "B" and Cows "C".
Bulls are the digits that you guessed existing and are in the correct position in your opponent's number. Cows are the digits that you guessed existing but not in their correct position in your opponent's number. Don't worry about this part, the game will do all the calculations. You just have to focus and try quickly.
The winner is the player who finds his opponent number first. Each round (A round is composed of 2 turns: your turn and you opponent turn) a test will be executed to see if someone won.

### Win 

If the result of your guess is 4 Bulls and 0 Cows you win. This means you have found his number, but you only win if he doesn't.

### Loss: 

If your opponent finds your own number and you don't.

### Draw: 

If both players find each other's numbers after the same number of rounds/turns.

## Draft to help you focus : 

This is an area in the bottom of your game screen where are 10 possible digits are represented with button that change color on click.

- If the digit button color is orange it means you don't know wheather the digit exists in your opponent number or no.
- If the digit button color is green it means you are certain that the digit exists in your opponent number.
- If the digit button color is grey it means you are certain that the digit doesn't exist in your opponent number.
